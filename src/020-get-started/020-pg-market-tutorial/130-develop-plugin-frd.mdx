title: Developing a plugin for product promotions (frontend part)
---

In the previous section we created a minimal Pinglue package which adds an empty controller to the frontend hub. Now in this section we add some code to this controller to achieve our goal; i.e., showing the promoted items on the top of the search result.

Extending channel db-response-process
---------------------------------------

As we discussed in the previous section, the key to modify the search result is to extend the channel *db-response-process* . 

For the details of this channel, and what formats its params and value have please refer to the `channels/frontend/registers.yaml` file at the *db-access-pl* package root folder, or alternatively run:

*from pg-market main folder*
```
npx pg channels-man frontend -c db-response-process
```

<Warn>
    The outcome of the above command depends on how this channel is documented in the package channels folder, and it might be rather empty. 
</Warn>

<Tip>
    If you find the outcome of `npx pg channels-man` unhelpful create a PR for the respective package to add more info for the channel. meanwhile, you can refer to the source code as the ultimate source of truth for the channel's details.
</Tip>

<Info>
    In the future we will have some UI tools to show these info for channels.
</Info>


Just to make this tutorial more self-contain, here is a brief description of channel *db-response-process*: 

* The params format is object with fields `collection, group, query, paginationInfo`

* The value is the query response: an object with fields `totalCount, result`. The result field is the array of products.

Frontend controller code
--------------------------

Now if you followed the tutorials on Pinglue, you should be able to easily guess what to write for the frontend controller code. (The copy/pasted template also has hints regarding as how to glue a handler to a channel or how to run a channel, etc.)

Here is the complete code:

*./src/frontend/index.ts*
```typescript
import {Controller} from "pinglue/browser";

export default class extends Controller {

    async init() {      

        // Glue some handler:
        this.glue(
            "db-response-process", 
            this.dbResponseHandler.bind(this)
        );

    }
    
    async dbResponseHandler(params, value) {
        
        // if the query is not for product collection then do nothing
        if (params.collection !== "products") 
            return;

        // if the query result does not have the right format just quit
        if (!Array.isArray(value.result))
            return;

        // else, modify the result:

        const promotionInfo = await this.getPromotions();

        // an array of promoted 
        const promotedProductsTitles = promotionInfo
            .map(item => item.title);

        const promotedItems = [];
        const regularItems = [];

        for (const item of value.result) {
            if (promotedProductsTitles.includes(item.title))
                promotedItems.push(item)
            else
                regularItems.push(item);
        }

        // the return object will be merged with the original value (=query response)

        return {
            result: [...promotedItems, ...regularItems]
        };

    }

    /**
     * 
     * @returns a list of promotions (from the backend db)
     */
    private async getPromotions() {
        
        // TODO: this will have to the the list of the deals from the backend. For now we hardcode it:

        const promotionInfo = [

            {
                title: "Brown eggs",
                percentageOff: 60
            },            
            {
                title: "Caprese salad",
                percentageOff: 45
            },

        ];

        return promotionInfo;
    }
   
}
```

That's it!

<Warn>
    Since we are using typescript, remember to compile your code after changing it (`npx tsc -b`), or alternatively run the typescript compile in watch mode (`npx tsc -w`) - otherwise you don't see any changes!!
</Warn>

Now run the pgweb server and Gatsby server in the pg-market main project and run the search. You should see the promoted items on top of the list.

Note that in the code above we are using a hardcoded data regarding promotions. This data is supposed to come from the backend, but at this moment our plugin is a frontend-only plugin and has no connection to the backend. 

In the next section we add a backend controller which fetches promotion data from the database and sends it to the frontend, and thus we will have a full-stack plugin.
