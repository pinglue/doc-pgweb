What you need to have installed before this tutorial:

- NodeJS (v14.18.0 or higher)
- Npm (v or higher)
- have the Pinglue monorepo cloned and built For detail refer to [here](id:monorepo-setup)


Third party tools
-------------------

pgweb uses Mongodb as its main database, so:

- A local Mongodb server at its default port (i.e., 27017) 

pgweb offers different choices for storing sessions info. The common one (and the one used in this tutorial) is to use a Redis server. So: 

- A local Redis server at its default port (i.e, 6379)

pgweb allows us to use any frontend framework (from raw HTML to high-end Angular) This tutorial uses GatsbyJS framework to build the frontend. So: 

- gatsby CLI installed (just go: `npm install -g gatsby-cli`)
