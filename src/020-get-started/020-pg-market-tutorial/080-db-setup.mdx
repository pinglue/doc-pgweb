title: Database setup
---

In section [](:mongodb-setup) we setup a Mongodb database called *pg-market-db* for our app. 

The plugin *@pinglue/mongodb-pl* that we installed in section [](enter-pg) is the plugin that provides access to database for the backend hub. This is meant to be the only way to access database in pgweb framework.

Any plugin that needs to read or store information has to use the channel *get-mongodb-collection* provided by *mongodb-pl* plugin to access the database. 

Having installed *mongodb-pl*, now we need to give our Mongodb address and credentials to plugin *mongodb-pl* so that it can connect to it. This, as you may guess, is done through the *settings* of this plugin. 

Looking at the settings schema of this plugin, we find:

*packages/@pinglue*
```yaml
settings:

  type: object

  properties:
  
    dbName:
      type: string
      default: pinglueDB

    host:
      type: string
      default: localhost

    port:
      type: number
      default: 27017

    username:
      type: string

    password:
      type: string

    queryString:
      type: string

      
    driverOptions:
      type: object
      properties:
        useUnifiedTopology: 
          type: boolean
          default: true
```

where it is clear what each settings field should mean. You can run the command `pg info` to see the current settings for the package *@pinglue/mongodb-pl*

*main project folder*
```
npx pg info -k @pinglue/mongodb-pl
```

Assuming that your Mongodb is using the default setup in localhost, we just need to set the database name (field *dbName* above) to *pg-market-db*. 

So in the main project folder create a new file at `data/@pinglue/mongodb-pl/settings.yaml`:

```yaml
dbName: pg-market-db
```

That's it! Confirm your Mongodb settings is correct by running the command `pg info` again.

<Warn>If your Mongodb setting is different than what we assume here then set the right values in the *settings.yaml* file of *mongodb-pl* package</Warn>
