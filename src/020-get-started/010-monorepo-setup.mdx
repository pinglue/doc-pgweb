1. Setup a regular Pinglue monorepo along with additional pgweb packages (coming from the pgweb monorepo) as explained in [this guide](id:monorepo-setup). Then, following the same guide, add *pgweb* packages to your Pinglue monorepo by cloning the pgweb repository. To be more accurate, clone the pgweb repo inside the *packages* folder:

*within folder `packages`*
```shell
git clone ... pgweb
```

<Recall>All folders within the folder *packages*, other than *pinglue*, *@pinglue* and *scripts*, are ignored by the root project git. So the cloned *pgweb* repo (and basically any other cloned folder within packages) will NOT be part of the monorepo in any way such as submodule, subtree, etc. Each cloned repo within the *packages* folder will have to be pushed independently into its respective repo. This allows for independent package development. </Recall>

2. Bootstrap the monorepo (to include bootstrapping the newly added pgweb packages):

*from project root*
```
npm run bt
```

3. Build typescript files in pgweb packages:

*from project root*
```
npm run build-ts -- --scope=@pgweb/* 
```

You should see all success messages.

4. Now you probably want to use pgweb packages in some project. You can create your project in any folder you want within the folder *packages*. For our tutorials we usually create a new folder with the format `@project-name` within folder *packages* where we place the main project folder (normally called *main*) along with all the custom packages. So for example, if our project is called *Pg market* the folder structure will be:

```
packages
|___pinglue
|___@pinglue
|___scripts
|___@pg-market
|   |___main (main project folder)
|   |___custom-package1
|   |___custom-package2
```

<Note>The above structure is just a suggestion. You can follow any other folder structure you want. Any folder descending from folder *packages* can host a npm package, so you are free to come yo with your own structure. </Note>
